// Mount-time floppy image loader (Phase 1 of FLOPPY_WRITE_PLAN.md).
//
// Floppies were previously a one-way ioctl_download blob into SDRAM - see
// finding 1.3 in the plan. This module replaces that with a real SD
// block-device mount: on img_mounted it streams the whole image in via
// sd_rd, sector by sector, into the SAME SDRAM byte offsets the read side
// (dskReadAddrInt/Ext in addrController_top.v) already expects, so nothing
// downstream of SDRAM changes. Still read-only - no sd_wr, no write-back.
//
// Each sector is staged into a small local BRAM as it streams in (sd_buff_wr
// has no rate limit against on-chip RAM), then drained out to SDRAM one word
// at a time through the shared extra-slot-3 port in addrController_top.v -
// that slot recurs roughly every 2us, so draining is the slow half of a
// mount (a 1600-sector 800K image takes on the order of a second). Load-
// then-drain per sector, not double-buffered - correctness first; Phase 1's
// gate is booting exactly as before, not load speed.
//
// `done` (and therefore the caller's insertDisk latch) does not fire until
// the whole image is resident, so the Mac can never observe a disk that is
// only partially loaded - the SD-mount equivalent of the old code's
// old_down-&&-~dio_download end-of-download latch.
